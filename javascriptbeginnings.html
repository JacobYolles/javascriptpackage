Javascript uses 5 ways of data manipulation. 
1. Operators/Accessors, 2. Loops, 3. Conditionals, 4. Functions, 5. Event Listeners.

1. Operators/Accessors: The way that the user can manipulate the value a variable holds.
Operators 1: Arithmatic Operators: Used to make a single numerical value from numerical operands. These are: 1. + Addition, 2.- Subtraction, 

3. * Multiplication, 4. / Division, 5. % Modulus (the remainder from division.) 6. ++ Increment (increasing a number by one) 7. -- Decrement (decreasing a number by one)
Combining values and operators will force them to become expressions which will get evaluated to a single value. 
Ex: 3 - 2; (evalutates out to 1.)
The value of an expression may be stored as a variable.
let number = 3 - 2; (evaluates out to 1.)
Some operators can be applied directly on variables thus adjusting their values. 
let number = 3 - 2; 
number ++ 
number evaluates out to 2 because it was incremented by one.
let sum = 3 + 2;
(using var in the next instance just to show the interchangability.)
var product = 1 * 2; Product will hold the value of 2.
Being able to create variables that are within and used by other variables.
Ex: 
var goalNumber = 8; 
var half = goalNumber / 2;
Var goalNumber will assign itself the value of 8 and var half will assign itself the value of 4.

Comparison Operators: 
Comparison Operators are operators that form an expression that compares two values and evaluates whether it is true or false. 
Example: 50 > 25; (true) and 50 < 25; (false).
