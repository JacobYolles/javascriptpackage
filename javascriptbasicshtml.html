        <h2>Starting with a few definitions: </h2>
        
        <p> 
        String: Collections of characters. (words and sentences.) They are helped with quotation marks that help tell the computer that the value is a string. <br>
        Numbers: Integers, or Decimals, they can be either positive or negative. <br>
        Booleans, A true or false, value. Yes or no.
    </p>

    <p> A couple of examples: <br>
        Favorite Food String: "pizza" <br>
        Number Example: 1, -1 0.1 -0.1 <br>
        Boolean Example: one of two values, so either true, or false. 
    </p>
        
  
       <h2> Arrays: </h2> 
       <p>Arrays are lists of things. Arrays are identified by brackets [] and the elements in them are separated by commas. Arrays can hold lists of numbers, strings, or even other arrays.
        <br>
        Objects: Key value pairs. A value that holds a bunch of key value pairs. Identified by {} Example: { cereal: "a breakfast item", milk: "what goes on the cereal"} Objects are marked by curly braces and the key value pairs being separated by colons.
        <br>
        
        An array with three strings: ["hello", "welcome", "goodbye"]
        <br>
        An array with three numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        <br>
        
        An object example: The object represents an individual with a property called name with a string value of the name and property called age, with a number value of the age.
        <br>
    </p>

        <p>
        { <br>
            name: "jake", <br>
            age: 26 <br>
            } <br>
        </p>
        
       <h2> Variables: </h2> 
       <p>These are used to store values for later use. Variables are created using the var, let, or const key words. Variables use = to allow the variable to obtain a value.
    </p>
    
        <p>
        Example: Creating a variable of favorite food: <br>
        var favFood = "pizza" <br>
        or <br>
        let favFood = "pizza"<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        By using var or let instead of const it allows the variable to change its value later on.
        <br>
        
        Example: Creating a variable of favorite number: <br>
        var favNumber = 32 <br>
        or <br>
        let favNumber = 32 <br>
        <br>
        
        Example: Creating a boolean variable. Prompt: Is the user cold? <br>
        var isCold = true <br>
        or <br>
        let isCold = false <br>
    </p>
