LOOKING AT LOOPS:
Loops are used to be able to execute code over and over and over.
One example of this is using a loop to access an element in an array over and over again.
There are several types of loops.

FOR LOOPS:
For loops use the word for and are used to run a block of code a set amount of times. The most standard use of for loops is to access all the elements in an array.

AN EXAMPLE: 
Here lists an example of a simple for loop:
for (var i = 0; i < 5 i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
Breaking down this for loop, it states, for variable i, when it is equal to 0, less than 5 and adding one until 5, console log the value of i at that point. The console log will show the following:
0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Similarly using this same for loop it is possible to account for a creation of checking the numbers up to any value.
Example trying to get to console log out 0 - 10.
for (var i = 0; i < 11 i++) {
    console.log(i)
}
Note: as shown above the value that wants to be the final number must be one above the number that is targeted, (if the desired end number is 10 the loop must have i < 11.)

This same property can be used in a reversable sense.
